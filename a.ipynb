We quantitatively characterize sorting activity as the traversal of a problem space, showing that arrays of autonomous elements sort themselves more reliably and robustly than traditional implementations in the presence of errors. Moreover, we find the ability to temporarily reduce progress in order to navigate around a defect, and unexpected clustering behavior among the elements in chimeric arrays whose elements follow one of two different algorithms.

This research introduces a novel method for reducing the computational demands of large language models while preserving performance. Through the implementation of sparse attention patterns and progressive network pruning, we achieve a 70% decrease in energy usage with only a 2% accuracy trade-off on standard benchmarks. These results demonstrate that environmental sustainability in AI systems is achievable without significant performance degradation. \n",
